# E-Resume

Welcome to the 'E-Resume' project! This is a web-based resume I created during my university days using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple project that showcases different sections, including:

- Home
- About Me
- Education
- Portfolio
- Working Experience

**To View Your Resume:**

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This file serves as the entry point to the digital resume.

**Important Note:**

Please be aware that this project is a snapshot from my university days and may not be fully up-to-date. Feel free to use it as a starting point and make any necessary updates to tailor it to your current profile.

Thank you for checking out 'E-Resume'! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
